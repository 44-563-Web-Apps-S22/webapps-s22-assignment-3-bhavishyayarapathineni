        <h1>Bhavishya Yarapathineni</h1>
        <p>Basically i am a fun loving person and i really like to hangout with my family and friends.
            I really like making crafts with waste in the leisure time. I am optimistic and try to keep 
            the work environment with good and positive vibes. I really like watching k-dramas and c-dramas
            with my sister.

        <h4>Sakhi</h4>
        <p>
             I really like the movie sakhi which was directed by legendary director Maniratnam and the music 
             was composed by A.R.Rahman. I really like the main story line of the movie which is a simple roamntic 
             relationship between two young people who elope and the maturing of love among urban Indians who are 
             conflicted between tradition and modernity.
