    <h1> Code Display </h1>
    <blockquote> In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, 
        either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements
         to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is generally
          considered as a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes
           (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character 
           encoding. String may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types
            and structures. </blockquote >
